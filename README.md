# üåü Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio website, showcasing my background, projects, work experience, and technical skills.

This site is built using **Vue.js 3**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed via **Netlify**.
I chose this stack to strengthen my skills in Vue and Tailwind, having previously worked mostly with React and plain CSS.
